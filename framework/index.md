# Interview Framework

The 8-step framework that keeps you structured under pressure and signals seniority to interviewers.

## Why This Framework Matters

Senior-level system design interviews judge:
- Your ability to scope problems before jumping into solutions
- How you prioritize constraints like latency, availability, and cost
- Your awareness of trade-offs and alternatives
- Your ability to lead the conversation when requirements are incomplete

## The 8 Steps

1. **[Clarify Requirements](clarify-requirements.html)** - Understand the problem
2. **[Estimate Scale](estimate-scale.html)** - Back-of-envelope calculations
3. **[Define Core Entities](define-core-entities.html)** - Identify the key data objects
4. **[Define API](define-api.html)** - Design the system interface
5. **[High-Level Architecture](high-level-architecture.html)** - Major components
6. **[Deep Dive Components](deep-dive-components.html)** - Focus on 1-2 areas
7. **[Bottlenecks & Scaling](bottlenecks-scaling.html)** - Identify failure points
8. **[Trade-offs & Alternatives](tradeoffs-alternatives.html)** - Show flexibility

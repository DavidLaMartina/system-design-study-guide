# Questions and Answers #

The following are questions I asked myself during the course of study, while watching or listening to system design problem lectures, reading various course materials, and having conversations with ChatGPT and Claude. This Q&A set is currently unstructured and will likely grow to become quite unwieldy for other users, but my intent is to get around to some sort of tagging or segmentation system that makes it easier for others to draw more benefit.

### How do multiple Redis instances work? ###

**Question**: With multiple Redis instances at play in a single system, how do they share context, if at all? For example, if I'm using Redis in a URL shortener, how do I avoid collisions with multiple instances?

**Answer**:

**Multi-instance Redis Configurations**
**Redis Cluster**: The formal clustering solution in which data is *automatically* sharded across multiple nodes. Each node holds a subset of the hash slots (16,384 total) and clients automatically route requests to the correct node.
**Master-Replica Setup**: One primary instance handles writes, with read-only replicas. This provides read scaling and failover capability but doesn't distribute write load.
**Independent Instances**: Complete separate Redis instances serving different purposes or applications, with no coordination between them.
**Sharded Setup**: Application-level partitioning in which your code decides which Redis instance to use based on some key logic.

**Handling Collisions and Consistency**
Redis takes several approaches, depending on the setup:
**In Redis Cluster**, collision prevention works through hash slot assignment. Each key is deterministically mapped to one of 16,384 hash slots, and each slot belongs to exactly one master node. This eliminates the possibility of the same key existing on multiple nodes simultaneously.
**For cross-instance operations**, Redis Cluster uses a two-phase commit-like protocol for multi-key operations that span nodes, although this is ilmited. Most multi-key operations must involve keys on the same node.
**Replication uses eventual consistency**: Replicas asynchronously receive updates from masters, so there is a window during which replicas might be behind.

**ACID Properties in Redis**
Redis has limited ACID guarnatees even in insingle-instance scenarios:
* **Atomicity**: Single operations are atomic, and you can use MULTI/EXEC transactions or Lua scripts for multi-operation atomicity.
* **Consistency**: Redis maintains data structure invariants.
* **Isolation**: Operations don't interfere with each other during execution.
* **Durability**: Configurable through RDB snapshots and AOF logging.
**In multi-instance setups**, full ACID across instances becomes more complex and less guaranteed. Redis Cluster sacrifices some consistency for availability and partition tolerance (following CAP theorem). Cross-node transactions are very limited, and you generally can't have ACID transactions spanning multiple Redis nodes.

**Practical Approaches**:
Most applications handle this by:
**1. Designing for single-node transactions** wherever possible.
**2. Using application-level coordination** for cross-instance operations.
**3. Accepting eventual consistency** for replicated data.
**4. Implementing compensation patterns** for distributed operations that need rollback capabilities.

Overall, Redis prioritizes performance and simplicity over strict ACID guarantees in distributed scenarios. If you need strong consistency across multiple instances, you might need additional coordination mechanisms, or you might consider whether Redis / Redis Cluster is right for your use case.

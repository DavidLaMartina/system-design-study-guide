# Scaling Patterns

Reusable strategies for making systems handle more load, more data, or higher reliability requirements without collapsing.

## Why Scaling Patterns Matter

Every successful system eventually hits limits. Engineers don't just react to outages; they proactively apply proven patterns to scale *before* breaking points. A deep understanding of these patterns will help you to:
* **Choose the right tool** for any given bottleneck
* **Communicate trade-offs** clearly during design discussions and reviews
* **Avoid common pitfalls** that teams encounter when scaling
* **Estimate effort** for scaling initiatives

## Pattern Categories ##

### Infrastructure Scaling ###
* **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** - cache static or semi-static content globally
* **Application caching** - store frequently accessed data in fast storage

### Database Scaling ###
* **Database replication**: Keep copies across multiple servers
* **Sharding**: Split large datasets into independent chunks

### System Decoupling ###
* **Message queues**: buffer between producers and consumers

## How to Use These Patterns ##
Consider:
* Problem solved
* Implementation approach
* Failure modes
* Real-world examples
* Operational considerations (monitoring, configuration, scaling)

## Pattern Selection Framework ##
When facing bottlenecks, ask:
1. Where is the constraint? (CPU, memory, network, storage)
2. What's the access pattern (read-heavy, write-heavy, mixed)
3. What are the consistency requirements?
4. What's the acceptable complexity increase (ops overhead, development time & maintenance)

## Common Scaling Progression ##
Most systems evolve through these stages:
**Stage 1**: Monolith + CDN + Database
* Single server application
* Static content via CDN
* Primary DB with backups
**Stage 2**: Horizontal App Scaling + Read Replicas
* Load-balanced applicatino servers
* Database read replicas for query scaling
* Application-level caching (Redis / memcached)
**Stage 3**: Service decomposition + message queues
* Break monolith into services
* Async processing via queues
* Service-specific databases
**Stage 4**: Data Partitioning + Geographic Distribution
* Database sharding for write scaling
* Multi-region deployment
* Event-driven architecture

## Real-World Scaling Examples ##
**Twitter's Timeline Evolution**
* V1: Generate timeline on-demand (slow)
* V2: pre-compute timelines for all users (storage expensive)
* V3: Hybrid approach - celebrities computed on-demand (cached), others pre-computed

**Instagram's database journey**
* V1: Single PostgreSQL instance
* V2: Read replicas for photo metadata
* V3: Sharding by user ID
* V4: Cassandra for activity feeds

**WhatsApp's measage delivery**
* V1: Direct server-to-server delivery
* V2: Message queues for offline users
* V3: Connection pooling and prioritized delivery
* Result: 2 billion users with minimal infrastructure

## Application ##
When discussing scaling in interviews or design reviews:
1. Start with the bottleneck / primary constraint
2. Reference patterns by name, e.g. "We could apply DB replication to handle the read load."
3. Explain trade-offs, e.g. "A CDN reduces latency but adds cache invalidation complexity."
4. Show progression, e.g. "Initially we'd use caching, but at 10x scale we'd need sharding."
